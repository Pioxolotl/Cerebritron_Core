# Cerebritron System Architecture

## Overview

Cerebritron is an advanced system that integrates artificial intelligence, smart home systems, and robotics into a single coherent ecosystem. Its purpose is to create an intelligent environment capable of predicting user needs, managing contextual memory, automating complex workflows, and recording complete decision chains.

This document outlines the architecture of the Cerebritron system, detailing the five main layers, their responsibilities, interfaces, and communication patterns.

## System Architecture

The Cerebritron system is organized into a hierarchical layer structure, where each layer has strictly defined responsibilities and communication interfaces:

1. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**
2. **Perception System (PS)**
3. **Cognitive Core (CC)**
4. **Action Controller (AC)**
5. **System Monitor (SM)**


## Communication Patterns

The Cerebritron system uses different communication patterns for different types of data and requirements:

1. **Fast, Real-time Data (HAL → PS, AC, CC)**: ZeroMQ Streams
   - Used for raw binary data from sensors
   - Example: `{sensor_id: 1, data: [0x00, 0x01], timestamp: T}`

2. **Semantic Events (PS → CC)**: REST API
   - Used for processed perceptual data
   - Example: `{"event": "gesture_command", "data": "run"}`

3. **High-level Commands (CC → AC)**: REST API
   - Used for action directives
   - Example: `{"action": "move_robot", "params": {...}}`

4. **Control Commands (AC → HAL)**: gRPC or ZeroMQ Streams
   - Used for direct hardware control
   - Example: `{actuator_id: 1, command: "rotate", angle: 45}`

5. **Metrics and Logs (All → SM)**: Prometheus/ELK
   - Used for system monitoring
   - Example: `{component: "PS", metric: "latency", value: 5ms}`

6. **System Events (SM → CC)**: REST API
   - Used for alerts and system status
   - Example: `{"alert": "high_cpu", "severity": "warning"}`

## Layer Details

### 1. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
