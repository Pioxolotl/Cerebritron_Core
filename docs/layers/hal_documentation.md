# Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Documentation

## Overview

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provides a unified interface to interact with various hardware devices, including sensors and actuators. It abstracts the complexity of hardware interactions, allowing other layers to communicate with hardware through standardized interfaces regardless of the specific hardware implementation.

## Key Components

### Device Interfaces

The HAL defines abstract interfaces for different types of devices:

- **DeviceInterface**: Base interface for all devices
  - Provides methods for initialization, shutdown, and status retrieval
  - Defines common device information structure

- **SensorInterface**: Interface for input devices
  - Extends DeviceInterface with methods for reading data
  - Provides validation mechanisms for sensor readings

- **ActuatorInterface**: Interface for output devices
  - Extends DeviceInterface with methods for writing commands
  - Handles command validation and execution

### Hardware Manager

The Hardware Manager serves as the central component for managing all hardware devices:

- **Device Registration**: Registers devices with the system
- **Device Discovery**: Discovers available devices
- **Device Configuration**: Configures devices based on system settings
- **Device Monitoring**: Monitors device status and health
- **Command Routing**: Routes commands to appropriate devices

### Device Categories

The HAL supports various device categories:

#### Sensors (Input Devices)
- **Microphones**: Audio input devices
  - Captures raw audio data
  - Supports various audio formats and sampling rates
  - Configurable for different sensitivity levels and noise cancellation

- **Cameras**: Visual input devices
  - Captures image and video data
  - Supports different resolutions and frame rates
  - Configurable for various lighting conditions

- **Environmental Sensors**:
  - Temperature sensors
  - Humidity sensors
  - Pressure sensors
  - Light sensors

- **Presence Detectors**:
  - Motion sensors
  - Proximity sensors
  - Occupancy sensors

#### Actuators (Output Devices)
- **Speakers**: Audio output devices
  - Plays audio data
  - Supports various audio formats
  - Configurable volume and audio characteristics

- **Displays**: Visual output devices
  - Shows visual information
  - Supports different resolutions and refresh rates

- **Control Devices**:
  - Relays
  - Switches
  - Motors
  - Servos

## Device Information Model

Each device in the HAL is represented by a `DeviceInfo` structure containing:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the device
- **Name**: Human-readable name
- **Type**: Device type (e.g., microphone, camera, speaker)
- **Category**: Device category (sensor or actuator)
- **Protocol**: Communication protocol used by the device
- **Capabilities**: Set of capabilities supported by the device
- **Manufacturer**: Device manufacturer
- **Model**: Device model
- **Firmware Version**: Current firmware version
- **Status**: Current device status (online, offline, error)
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp of the last status update

## Communication Patterns

The HAL communicates with other layers through:

- **Message Queue**: For asynchronous communication
- **REST API**: For configuration and management
- **Direct Function Calls**: For synchronous operations within the same process

## Service Architecture

The HAL is implemented as a standalone service with:

- **REST API**: For external communication
- **Configuration Management**: For device settings
- **Health Monitoring**: For service health checks
- **Logging**: For diagnostic information

## Implementation Details

### Device Registration

Devices can be registered with the HAL in several ways:

1. **Static Configuration**: Devices defined in configuration files
2. **Dynamic Discovery**: Devices discovered at runtime
3. **Manual Registration**: Devices registered through the API

### Error Handling

The HAL implements robust error handling:

- **Device Errors**: Handled at the device level
- **Communication Errors**: Handled at the communication level
- **Service Errors**: Handled at the service level

### Security

The HAL implements security measures:

- **Authentication**: For API access
- **Authorization**: For device operations
- **Encryption**: For sensitive data

## Usage Examples

### Initializing the HAL Service

```python
# This is a simplified example
service = HalService(config_path, master_password)
if service.initialize():
    service.run()
```

### Registering a Device

```python
# This is a simplified example
device = MicrophoneDevice(device_id="mic1", name="Main Microphone")
hardware_manager.register_device(device)
```

### Reading from a Sensor

```python
# This is a simplified example
sensor = hardware_manager.get_device("mic1")
if sensor and sensor.get_status() == DeviceStatus.ONLINE:
    data = sensor.read()
    # Process data
```

### Writing to an Actuator

```python
# This is a simplified example
actuator = hardware_manager.get_device("speaker1")
if actuator and actuator.get_status() == DeviceStatus.ONLINE:
    command = {"action": "play", "data": audio_data}
    actuator.write(command)
```

## Configuration

The HAL can be configured through:

- **Environment Variables**: For service configuration
- **Configuration Files**: For device configuration
- **API**: For runtime configuration

## Deployment

The HAL is deployed as a Docker container with:

- **Exposed API**: For external communication
- **Volume Mounts**: For configuration and data
- **Device Access**: For hardware interaction

## Extending the HAL

The HAL can be extended by:

1. **Creating New Device Implementations**: Implementing device interfaces
2. **Adding New Device Types**: Extending the device type enumeration
3. **Implementing New Protocols**: Supporting additional communication protocols
