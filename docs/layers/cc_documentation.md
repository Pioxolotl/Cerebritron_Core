# Cognitive Core (CC) Documentation

## Overview

The Cognitive Core (CC) serves as the "brain" of the Cerebritron system, processing perceptual information from the Perception System (PS) to understand user commands, conduct dialogue, reason about the environment, plan tasks, make decisions, and manage knowledge. It acts as the central intelligence hub that coordinates the system's cognitive functions.

## Key Components

### Context Integration

The Context Integration component combines data from different sources into a coherent context:

- **Multimodal Fusion**: Integrates information from different modalities (text, audio, etc.)
- **Temporal Integration**: Combines information across time
- **Spatial Integration**: Relates information to spatial contexts
- **Semantic Integration**: Connects information based on meaning

### Memory Matrix

The Memory Matrix is a hybrid memory system for knowledge management:

- **Vector Embeddings**: For semantic similarity search
  - Stores embeddings of concepts, entities, and experiences
  - Enables retrieval by semantic similarity
  - Supports fuzzy matching and association

- **Graph Relationships**: For structured relationships between entities
  - Represents connections between concepts and entities
  - Supports reasoning about relationships
  - Enables knowledge navigation

- **Structured Data**: For traditional relational data
  - Stores factual information in structured format
  - Supports precise querying and retrieval
  - Maintains data integrity and consistency

### Action Hub

The Action Hub translates decisions into concrete actions:

- **Action Translator**: Converts abstract commands into specific actions
  - Maps high-level intentions to executable commands
  - Resolves ambiguities in commands
  - Validates action feasibility

- **Output Harmonizer**: Selects the best communication channel
  - Determines optimal modality for responses
  - Balances between different output channels
  - Ensures consistent user experience

- **Safety Layer**: Checks actions for safety and compliance
  - Validates actions against safety constraints
  - Prevents conflicts between actions
  - Ensures compliance with system policies

### Explainability Layer

The Explainability Layer provides transparency for AI decisions:

- **Decision Graph**: Graph representation of decision paths
  - Records reasoning steps and decision points
  - Visualizes decision processes
  - Supports tracing of inference chains

- **Semantic Versioning**: Versioning system for decisions and models
  - Tracks changes in reasoning over time
  - Enables comparison between different decision versions
  - Supports rollback to previous reasoning states

- **Query Interface**: Interface for querying the explainability layer
  - Allows interrogation of decision processes
  - Supports natural language queries about reasoning
  - Provides evidence for decisions

- **Ethical Audit**: System for auditing decisions for ethical considerations
  - Evaluates decisions against ethical principles
  - Flags potential ethical issues
  - Provides recommendations for ethical improvements

### LLM Response Generators

The CC includes components for generating responses using Large Language Models:

- **Query Processing**: Processes user queries for LLM input
- **Context Management**: Manages conversation context for coherent responses
- **Response Generation**: Generates responses using LLMs
- **Response Validation**: Validates responses for accuracy and appropriateness

## Communication Patterns

The CC communicates with other layers through:

- **Message Queue**: For asynchronous communication
- **REST API**: For configuration, querying, and management
- **Direct Function Calls**: For synchronous operations within the same process

## Service Architecture

The CC is implemented as a standalone service with:

- **REST API**: For external communication
- **Configuration Management**: For cognitive settings
- **Health Monitoring**: For service health checks
- **Logging**: For diagnostic information

## Implementation Details

### Query Processing Pipeline

The CC implements a flexible query processing pipeline:

1. **Query Reception**: Queries are received from PS or external sources
2. **Context Enrichment**: Queries are enriched with contextual information
3. **Intent Recognition**: The intent of the query is recognized
4. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Relevant knowledge is retrieved from memory
5. **Response Generation**: A response is generated based on intent and knowledge
6. **Action Planning**: Actions are planned based on the response
7. **Response Delivery**: The response is delivered to the Action Controller

### Memory Management

The CC implements sophisticated memory management:

- **Short-term Memory**: For immediate context
- **Long-term Memory**: For persistent knowledge
- **Episodic Memory**: For event sequences
- **Semantic Memory**: For conceptual knowledge

### Error Handling

The CC implements robust error handling:

- **Query Errors**: Handled at the query level
- **Processing Errors**: Handled at the processing level
- **Knowledge Errors**: Handled at the knowledge level
- **Service Errors**: Handled at the service level

## Usage Examples

### Initializing the CC Service

```python
# This is a simplified example
service = CcService(config_path, master_password)
if service.initialize():
    service.run()
```

### Processing a Query

```python
# This is a simplified example
result = cognitive_manager.process_query({
    "type": "speech",
    "text": "What's the weather like today?"
})
# Handle result
```

### Storing a Memory Item

```python
# This is a simplified example
result = cognitive_manager.store_memory({
    "type": "fact",
    "content": "The user prefers classical music",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "source": "conversation"
})
# Handle result
```

### Retrieving Memory Data

```python
# This is a simplified example
memory_data = cognitive_manager.get_memory_data(
    query={"type": "fact"},
    limit=100,
    offset=0
)
# Process memory data
```

## Configuration

The CC can be configured through:

- **Environment Variables**: For service configuration
- **Configuration Files**: For cognitive component configuration
- **API**: For runtime configuration

### Configuration Options

- **Generators**: Configuration for response generators
  - LLM settings and parameters
  - Response formatting options
  
- **Memory**: Configuration for the memory matrix
  - Storage settings
  - Retention policies
  - Embedding models
  
- **Keywords**: List of keywords for activation
  - Wake words
  - Command prefixes
  - Attention signals

## Deployment

The CC is deployed as a Docker container with:

- **Exposed API**: For external communication
- **Volume Mounts**: For configuration and data
- **Resource Limits**: For CPU and memory management

## Extending the CC

The CC can be extended by:

1. **Creating New Generators**: Implementing new response generation methods
2. **Enhancing Memory Systems**: Adding new memory types or retrieval methods
3. **Improving Explainability**: Developing new explainability techniques
4. **Integrating External Knowledge**: Connecting to external knowledge sources
