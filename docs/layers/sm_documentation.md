# System Monitor (SM) Documentation

## Overview

The System Monitor (SM) is responsible for monitoring the health, performance, and security of the entire Cerebritron system. It collects metrics from all services, detects anomalies, manages system resources, and provides diagnostic information. The SM serves as the oversight layer that ensures the system operates reliably and efficiently.

## Key Components

### Health Monitor

The Health Monitor tracks the operational status of all system components:

- **Service Health Checks**: Periodically checks the health of all services
- **Component Status Tracking**: Monitors the status of individual components
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Tracks dependencies between components
- **Failure Detection**: Identifies service and component failures

### Resource Monitor

The Resource Monitor tracks system resource usage:

- **CPU Monitoring**: Tracks CPU usage across services
- **Memory Monitoring**: Monitors memory consumption
- **Disk Usage**: Tracks storage utilization
- **Network Usage**: Monitors network traffic and bandwidth

### Security Manager

The Security Manager oversees system security:

- **Authentication Monitoring**: Tracks authentication attempts
- **Authorization Checks**: Monitors access control
- **Threat Detection**: Identifies potential security threats
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Checks for system vulnerabilities

### Diagnostics

The Diagnostics component provides tools for troubleshooting:

- **Error Analysis**: Analyzes error patterns and root causes
- **Log Aggregation**: Collects and centralizes logs from all services
- **Trace Collection**: Gathers execution traces for debugging
- **Diagnostic Reports**: Generates comprehensive diagnostic reports

### Performance Analyzer

The Performance Analyzer evaluates system performance:

- **Response Time Tracking**: Monitors service response times
- **Throughput Measurement**: Tracks system throughput
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Identifies performance bottlenecks
- **Performance Reporting**: Generates performance reports

## Communication Patterns

The SM communicates with other layers through:

- **Message Queue**: For asynchronous communication
- **REST API**: For configuration, metrics collection, and management
- **Direct Function Calls**: For synchronous operations within the same process

## Service Architecture

The SM is implemented as a standalone service with:

- **REST API**: For external communication
- **Configuration Management**: For monitoring settings
- **Health Monitoring**: For self-monitoring
- **Logging**: For diagnostic information

## Implementation Details

### Monitoring Pipeline

The SM implements a comprehensive monitoring pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**: Metrics and status data are collected from all services
2. **Data Processing**: Collected data is processed and normalized
3. **Analysis**: Processed data is analyzed for patterns and anomalies
4. **Alerting**: Alerts are generated for detected issues
5. **Reporting**: Reports are generated for system status and performance
6. **Visualization**: Data is visualized for easier interpretation

### Health Check Loop

The SM implements a continuous health check loop:

- **Service Polling**: Regularly polls services for health status
- **Status Aggregation**: Combines status information from multiple sources
- **Health Scoring**: Calculates health scores for services and components
- **Status Reporting**: Reports health status to administrators

### Metrics Collection

The SM collects various metrics from all services:

- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **Service Metrics**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **Component Metrics**: Component-specific performance indicators
- **Custom Metrics**: User-defined metrics for specific monitoring needs

### Error Handling

The SM implements robust error handling:

- **Collection Errors**: Handled at the collection level
- **Processing Errors**: Handled at the processing level
- **Analysis Errors**: Handled at the analysis level
- **Service Errors**: Handled at the service level

## Usage Examples

### Initializing the SM Service

```python
# This is a simplified example
service = SmService(config_path, master_password)
if service.initialize():
    service.run()
```

### Getting System Health

```python
# This is a simplified example
health_data = system_monitor.get_health_data()
# Process health data
```

### Getting System Metrics

```python
# This is a simplified example
metrics_data = system_monitor.get_metrics_data(
    services=["hal", "ps", "cc", "ac"],
    metrics=["cpu", "memory", "response_time"],
    start_time=time.time() - 3600,  # Last hour
    end_time=time.time()
)
# Process metrics data
```

### Setting Alert Thresholds

```python
# This is a simplified example
result = system_monitor.set_alert_thresholds({
    "cpu": 80.0,  # Alert when CPU usage exceeds 80%
    "memory": 75.0,  # Alert when memory usage exceeds 75%
    "response_time": 500.0  # Alert when response time exceeds 500ms
})
# Handle result
```

## Configuration

The SM can be configured through:

- **Environment Variables**: For service configuration
- **Configuration Files**: For monitoring configuration
- **API**: For runtime configuration

### Configuration Options

- **Services**: Configuration for monitored services
  - Service endpoints
  - Health check intervals
  - Authentication settings
  
- **Alerts**: Configuration for alerting
  - Alert thresholds
  - Alert channels
  - Alert priorities
  
- **Metrics**: Settings for metrics collection
  - Collection intervals
  - Retention periods
  - Aggregation methods

## Deployment

The SM is deployed as a Docker container with:

- **Exposed API**: For external communication
- **Volume Mounts**: For configuration and data
- **Resource Limits**: For CPU and memory management

## Extending the SM

The SM can be extended by:

1. **Adding New Monitors**: Implementing monitors for new aspects of the system
2. **Enhancing Analysis**: Improving analysis algorithms and capabilities
3. **Expanding Reporting**: Implementing new reporting methods
4. **Integrating External Monitoring**: Connecting to external monitoring services
